        <div class="text-content life">
          <p>Painter, sculptor, architect and poet. This was Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti, or simply Michelangelo,
            one of the most brilliant artists of the Italian Renaissance and a name that remained in history. He was born
            on
            March 6, 1475, in the Caprese region, in Italian Tuscany. And he died on February 18, 1564, in the city of
            Rome,
            at the age of 89.</p>
          <p>He almost attended a grammar school in Florence, largely because of his father's wishes, who enrolled him at
            the age of seven. However, when Michelangelo Buonarroti was 10 years old, his father noticed and admitted his
            son's talent for the visual arts of drawing and painting.</p>
          <p>At a very young age, Michelangelo enrolled in the workshop of Domenico Ghilandaio, one of the greatest
            masters
            in Florence. There, he breathed art and had the best possible base for the production of drawings, paintings,
            frescoes and sculptures.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p>Michelangelo's talents became evident when he worked for Ghirlandaio. So within a year he was sent to the
            Medici family to continue his training with the sculptor Bertoldo di Geovanni. It was in the gardens of the
            Medici family that Michelangelo carved his first sculptures: Bacchus (1496–1497) and Sleeping Cupid (1496).
          </p>
          <p>He then focused on his work, creating for himself a renowned career as a painter and sculptor in the Italian
            Renaissance. Two of his most significant early works that helped him become a celebrated artist were the
            statues
            of “Pietà” (1499), which he sculpted at just 23 years old, and “David” (1501 – 1504), both recognized for
            their
            artistic technique.</p>
          <p>In 1505, the Italian sculptor was called by Pope Julius II to design his tomb, a project he worked on for
            four
            decades.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p>He dedicated years to creating the Sistine Chapel fresco, one of his most famous works and one of the most
            recognized paintings worldwide. Another of Michelangelo's works is his sculpture of David, carved from a
            single
            block of marble.</p>
          <p>The vault of the Sistine Chapel is perhaps Michelangelo's most famous work. Without a doubt, it is one of the
            grandest. In 1508, the then Pope Julius II commissioned the artist to carry out all the “decoration” of the
            vault of the Chapel, located in Saint Peter's Cathedral, in the city of Rome, where the Vatican is today.</p>
          <p>Despite his protests, in which he said he was not a painter but a sculptor, Michelangelo ended up carrying
            out
            the task. In exhaustive and long work over four years, during which he largely had no help, the artist painted
            300 images in a vault measuring 40 meters wide and 13 meters high.</p>
